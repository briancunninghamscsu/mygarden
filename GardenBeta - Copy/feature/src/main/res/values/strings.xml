        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"
        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        "Maintaining the proper ambient air temperature is critical for the well-being of a hydroponic garden.\n\nPlant metabolism requires a cooldown at night; it is thought that a difference of about 10°F down is ideal. Turning off the grow-lights during this colder period will produce optimal plant growth.\n\nIf you're growing this indoors, we recommend that you set your thermostat to be cooler at night to accommodate. Air Temperatures are traditionally controlled by ventilation and artificial heating, which is what My Garden implements.\n\nFor warm-season crops and herbs [tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, cucumbers, beans, squash, melons, herbs]\n\n"

        "Regardless of the crop grown, it never advised to allow the temperature of the garden reach temperatures of 86°F or above. This will induce a process called <i>photorespiration</i>, where the plant's internal sugar supplies are needlessly depleted, retarding growth.\n\nIt's also important to keep daytime temperatures above 70°F; temperatures below that will suppress the vegetative processes of <i>photosynthesis</i> and <i>respiration</i>.\n\nPlants don't photosynthesize at night. So, the respiration rate ought to be reduced because plants cannot store the product of this process. Respiration rates are reduced by cooling the temperature below 70°F.\n\n"

        "Humidity is a measure of water vapor in the air.\n\nIt can be measured in a few different ways, but the most common method is referred to as <i>Relative Humidity</i>. This is expressed as a percentage, describing how much water vapor there is in the air, relative to the maximum amount physically allowed at current air temperature. This is also the humidity value found in weather reports.\n"
    </string>

    <string name="learnabouthumidity2">
        "It's important to note that the amount of water vapor that air can hold is directly proportional to the temperature of the air. That is, the hotter the air, the more water it can hold. If all else is equal, one can decrease the relative humidity of a body of air simply by heating it up.\n\nThe relative humidity of the air that your plants are growing in will make an impact on their health.\n\nLow humidity (less than 50%) can cause problems in one's garden, particularly in regards to pollination. MyGarden has a fogging reservoir that emits water vapour when low humidities are detected.\n\nHowever, it's more common and more destructive to have high-humidity related problems.\n"

    <string name="learnabouthumidity3">
        "While plants are alive and healthy, they emit water through their leaves through a process called <i>transpiration</i>. This process is what circulates nutrients throughout the plant. But, when the humidity is too high (over 90%), the plants lose their ability to release this water from their systems. So, they stop circulating nutrients entirely.\n\n Also, in high-humidity conditions, the growing environment and the plant become susceptible to fungal diseases.\n\n"
